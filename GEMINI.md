# Project: Issue Reports & Learning Excerpts

## Overview
This repository is a collection of isolated code excerpts, minimal issue reproducers, and learning examples. It serves as a personal laboratory for exploring specific technical problems, sharing solutions, or demonstrating concepts across various technologies.

## Directory Structure
The repository follows a hierarchical structure categorized by technology or domain:

`<category> / <case name or subject> / ...code...`

### Current Categories
*   **`bazelbuild/`**: Examples and experiments related to core Bazel build system functionality.
*   **`rules_python/`**: Cases involving Python integration with Bazel, including debugging, environment management, and dependency issues.
*   **`rules_img/`**: Experiments with container image rules and related tooling.

## Usage
Each subdirectory represents a standalone project or case. To work with a specific excerpt:
1.  Navigate into the category and case folder.
2.  Follow the local README or configuration files within that specific directory.

Note: Since each case is isolated, there is no unified build or execution command for the entire repository.
