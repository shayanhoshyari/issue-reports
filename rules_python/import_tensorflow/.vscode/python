# This script is used by VS Code (via settings.json "python.defaultInterpreterPath")
# to use the Bazel-managed Python interpreter for Intellisense and Debugging.
# It acts as a wrapper around "bazel run @rules_python//python/bin:python".
#
# This allows VS Code to work without a system Python installed, and ensures
# that the environment matches what Bazel uses.
